## Extension Install

[**Opera** extension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) Coming Soon, this link leads to a rick roll, don't click it.

~~[**Chrome** Web Store]()~~ Hell nah am I paying $5 to Google for a developer account. Another reason is because they are deprecating Manifest V2,
which is crucial for this extension to work. I will not be paying $5 to Google just to have my extension work for a few months.

~~[**Firefox** extension]()~~ Same reason as Chrome, Firefox doesn't support the tabCapture API, which is crucial for this extension to work.

## Manual install
